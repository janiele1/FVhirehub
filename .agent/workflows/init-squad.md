# 🛠️ Squad Project Initialisation

When asked to "Initialise a Squad Project", perform the following actions:

1. **Create `PLAN.md`**
   - This file serves as the **Master Ledger**.
   - It must contain the following sections:
     - 🗺️ **Master Roadmap** (List of Milestones)
     - 📝 **Current Trajectory** (The active step)
     - 🚥 **Squad Status** (Table: Agent | Task | Status)
     - 🏗️ **Architecture** (Tech Stack & Decisions)

2. **Initialize File Structure (if new)**
   - Ensure standard folders exist: `/components`, `/lib`, `/app` (or `/pages`), `/styles`.
   - Ensure `.agent` folder exists with rules and workflows.

3. **Set Initial Status**
   - Update **Squad Status** table in `PLAN.md` with:
     - **Design Lead:** Waiting
     - **Builder:** Waiting
     - **Nerd:** Waiting
     - **Researcher:** Initializing

4. **Notify User**
   - Confirm initialization is complete and ask for the first milestone to populate the Roadmap.
