One-Way Interview App Research & Feature Recommendations
Executive Summary
The one-way (asynchronous) interview market ranges from simple, speed-focused tools to complex enterprise AI platforms. For a new internal app, the "sweet spot" appears to be simplicity and candidate experience (like Willo/Hireflix) rather than heavy enterprise compliance (HireVue).

Top Competitors Analysis
Competitor	Target Audience	Key Differentiators	Weaknesses
Willo	SMB to Enterprise	No candidate login required, extremely simple UI, mobile-first.	Less "heavy" on complex workflow automation compared to enterprise tools.
Spark Hire	Mid-Market	Strong branding, collaborative rating stars, good balance of features.	Can be pricier; slightly more friction than Willo.
HireVue	Enterprise	Heavy AI scoring ("employability" score), game-based assessments.	Expensive, complex setup, "Big Brother" vibe can alienate candidates.
Hireflix	SMB / Startups	"Ridiculously simple", focus on speed and ease of use.	Limited advanced features (reporting, deep integrations).
Feature Breakdown by Competitor
1. Willo (The Usability Winner)
Feature: "No account needed" for candidates. They click a link and record.
Feature: Works perfectly on mobile browsers without an app.
Feature: "Retake" limits (allow candidates to retake 0, 3, or unlimited times).
Feature: ID Verification (optional snapshot of ID).
2. Spark Hire (The Standard)
Feature: "Think time" vs "Answer time" settings.
Feature: Intro/Outro videos recorded by the recruiter to personalize the experience.
Feature: Star ratings and collaborative commenting for hiring managers.
3. HireVue (The AI Giant)
Feature: AI analysis of facial expressions and tone (Controversial but powerful for volume).
Feature: Structured interview builder to ensure fairness/compliance.
Recommended Feature Set for Your App
Based on the goal of building a "simple yet professional app quickly", I recommend modeling the core experience after Willo (ease of use) while borrowing the personalization of Spark Hire.

🚨 Phase 1: Must-Have Features (Core MVP)
These are non-negotiable for a functional and professional product.

Device-Agnostic Recorder (Mobile Web Support)
Why: 60%+ of candidates will use phones. Do NOT force them to download an app. Use modern web APIs (MediaRecorder) to record directly in the browser.
"No-Login" Candidate Flow
Why: Friction kills completion rates. Assessment links should be unique tokens (e.g., app.com/interview/uuid) that require no password.
Configurable "Think" & "Record" Times
Why: Different roles need different constraints.
Idea: Default to 1 min prep, 2 min answer.
Playback Speed Controls (1.5x, 2x)
Why: Recruiters need to scan videos quickly. This is the #1 feature for internal efficiency.
Branded Landing / Welcome Page
Why: Displays your company logo and a text/video welcome message to set the context.
Question Types
Text-to-Video (Recruiter types Q, Candidate records video).
Video-to-Video (Recruiter records Q, Candidate records video - High value for personal touch).
🚀 Phase 2: "Delight" & Power Features (To Stand Out)
Add these to make the app feel "premium" and better than basic tools.

🔮 Phase 3: Future AI Innovations
AI Summarization: "Candidate discussed Python experience and staying calm under pressure."
Keyword Highlighting: Auto-tag "React", "Node.js", "Leadership" in the timeline.
Technical Implications for MVP
Storage: Video files get heavy. Use cloud storage (AWS S3 / Google Cloud Storage) with signed upload URLs to upload directly from the browser (bypassing your server to save load).
Transcoding: Browsers record in different formats (WebM/MP4/MOV). feature a backend job (ffmpeg) to standardize them for universal playback.
